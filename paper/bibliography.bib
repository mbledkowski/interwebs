  abstract = {React is easily one of the single most popular libraries in use today. Given that it was made within a juggernaut like Facebook, you might have assumed it was always destined for success. But what if we told you that React’s first brush with the public sphere was anything but glamorous? React.js: The Documentary brings you the full story behind the early days of React, focusing on the dedicated group of developers who helped bring it to the world stage. This story is told by an all-star cast of developers like Tom Occhino, Christopher Chedeau, Pete Hunt, Sebastian Markbåge, Dan Abramov, and many more. Check out the home for untold developer stories around open source, careers and all the other cool stuff developers are doing at cult.honeypot.io.
